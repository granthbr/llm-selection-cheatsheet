# Optimizing Your Daily LLM Workflow

## Typical Use-Case Flow

1. **Draft, brainstorm, or initial Q&A:**  
   - Start with **GPT-3.5 Turbo** or **Claude Instant** for speed.

2. **Deep dive, reasoning, or research:**  
   - Move to **GPT-4 Turbo** or **Claude 2.1/Next** for complex tasks.

3. **Multimodal or agentic workflows:**  
   - Use **GPT-4o** or **Gemini Ultra** if you need file/image/audio handling.

4. **Coding, data analysis, or file workflows:**  
   - Use **Copilot Agent** for inline code.  
   - For interactive data/code: **GPT Codec** or **CLI tools** (Claude, Gemini).

5. **Sensitive or compliance-related tasks:**  
   - Prefer models that support watermarking/auditability (e.g., GPT-4).

## Pro Tips

- Don’t hesitate to compare outputs for key tasks between models.
- Use “agents” (multi-step tools, e.g. Copilot Agent, GPT-4o) for more complex workflows or chaining.
- Consider the latency and token limits for each platform as your workflow grows.
