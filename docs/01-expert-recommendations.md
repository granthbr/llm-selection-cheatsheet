# Expert Recommendations

How top thinkers approach LLM selection.

## Zvi Mowshowitz
- Advocates using **multiple models** as tools; don’t get stuck on one platform.
- Emphasizes prompt chaining and agentic design for reasoning tasks.

## Eliezer Yudkowsky
- LLMs = “next-token predictors.”  
- For safety-critical/agentic use: prefer highly-aligned, RLHF models.

## Scott Aaronson
- Focus: LLM watermarking for provenance/security.
- Prefer models that support watermark detection when integrity matters.

## Other Thinkers
- **Daniel Kokotajlo:** Open, modular LLMs for research.
- **Jeff Dean & Noam Shazeer:** Internal preference for Google Gemini (esp. 1.5+), multimodal and production workflows.
