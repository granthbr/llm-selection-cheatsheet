# Cheatsheet: Google (Gemini)

Google's Gemini models are distinguished by their massive context windows, native multimodality, and tight integration with Google's ecosystem.

| Model | Strength & Speciality | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gemini 1.5 Pro** | **Massive Context Window and Multimodality.** Its defining feature is the 1 million token context window, allowing it to process and reason over vast amounts of information (e.g., an entire codebase, multiple long documents, or hours of video). It has strong multimodal capabilities. | **When you need to analyze and synthesize information from a very large corpus of text or other media.** Ideal for in-depth analysis of large codebases, extensive research projects, and summarizing and querying information from multiple lengthy sources at once. |
| **Gemini 1.5 Flash** | **Speed and Efficiency with a Large Context.** A lighter-weight version of 1.5 Pro that still offers a large context window but is optimized for speed and lower latency. | **For applications that need to process large amounts of information quickly.** Good for more responsive chatbots that need to recall information from long conversations or for real-time analysis of large documents. |
| **Gemini Advanced (in the UI)** | **Access to Google's latest features.** This is the premium user experience that typically provides access to Gemini 1.5 Pro and other cutting-edge features integrated into Google's services. | Use this for your general-purpose interactive queries within the Google ecosystem, especially when you want to leverage its integration with tools like Google Workspace. |

## For Your Workflow

* **Gemini CLI:** The Gemini CLI, powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro, is a powerful tool for developers. Its ability to ingest and reason about an entire project directory makes it excellent for high-level architectural questions, identifying dependencies, and generating documentation. Its integration with Google Search can also provide more up-to-date and factual responses.
