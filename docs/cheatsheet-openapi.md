# Cheatsheet: OpenAI (ChatGPT & API)

OpenAI's models are often praised for their strong all-around performance and creative flair.

| Model | Strength & Speciality | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPT-4o ("Omni")** | **Speed and Multimodality.** The current flagship, offering a near-GPT-4 level of intelligence with significantly faster response times. It excels at conversational AI, creative writing, and tasks requiring quick turnarounds. Its "omni" capabilities allow it to process and discuss images. | **Your default choice for most interactive tasks in the ChatGPT UI.** Ideal for brainstorming, content creation, and general-purpose queries where speed is a factor. Also, your go-to for any task involving image analysis. |
| **GPT-4** | **Deep Reasoning and Accuracy.** Still a top-tier model for complex reasoning, intricate problem-solving, and tasks demanding high accuracy. It can be more "thoughtful" and less prone to the occasional "laziness" or sycophancy reported in faster models. | **When precision is paramount.** Use for complex legal or technical document analysis, in-depth research, and challenging reasoning problems where you want the most robust possible answer and are willing to wait a little longer. |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | **Large Context and Speed.** A faster version of GPT-4 with a large context window, making it suitable for processing long documents and conversations. It offers a good balance between speed, cost, and capability. | **Through the API for tasks involving large documents.** Summarizing long reports, analyzing extensive codebases, or maintaining context in a long-running chat application. |
| **Specialized Models (DALL-E 3, etc.)** | **Image Generation and other modalities.** OpenAI offers a suite of specialized models for tasks like image generation, text-to-speech, and transcription. | Use these for their specific purpose when you need high-quality outputs in their respective domains. |

## For Your Workflow

* **GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode):** While the underlying models can vary, Copilot often leverages OpenAI's models, particularly those optimized for code. Use this for interactive code generation, debugging, and refactoring directly in your IDE.
* **GPT via UI and API:** Continue to use the ChatGPT interface with GPT-4o for quick, interactive tasks. For more complex, programmatic workflows, especially those requiring large context or specific model versions, the API with GPT-4 or GPT-4 Turbo is the way to go.
